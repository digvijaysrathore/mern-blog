				<p className="text prof-info">I am an outgoing, personable individual. Through my travels I believe I have developed good people skills. My passion for travelling the world took me to Europe where I am pursued my Master in International Business from Grenoble Graduate School of Business (GGSB), France. Experiences at GGSB have enhanced and brushed my professional skills.
				The time spent in Europe got me thinking about the nation brands that we experience in Europe. This experience pushed me towards exploring Indian brands. After my master in France, I joined Roadhouse Hostels in Goa to build an excellent budget hospitality brand. My contribution to the company in the capacity of a marketing, operations and finance associate helped them grow in a chain of 5 hostels in 3 different cities. 
				Currently, I am working on a premium Yoga & sports brand named Curveit. So far, Curveit has launched 6 products in 16 different variations helping people get healthier and fitter. Recently, we have also launched our products in the UAE market (more on this later). 
				Earlier, I completed my Bachelor in Business Administration from Christ University, Bangalore. 
				In the role of a Gandhi Fellow, I have consulted 5 municipal schools for better functioning of the public education system by identifying the issues and resolving them to bridge the differences between the school and the communities.</p>
